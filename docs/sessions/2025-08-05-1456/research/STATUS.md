## Next Steps

**For @agent-project-manager**:
1. Review comprehensive research findings
2. Prioritize implementation phases based on business needs
3. Create detailed technical specifications for selected monitoring components  
4. Establish implementation timeline and resource allocation
5. Define success metrics and testing criteria

**Recommended Priority Order**:
1. Basic health checks and HTTP metrics (Week 1)
2. External API circuit breakers (Week 2) 
3. Background job monitoring (Week 3)
4. Advanced cryptocurrency monitoring (Month 1)
