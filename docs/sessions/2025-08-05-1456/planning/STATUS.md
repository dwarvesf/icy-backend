## Risk Assessment and Mitigations

### High Risks
1. **Performance Impact**: Monitoring overhead affecting response times
   - *Mitigation*: Strict performance budgets and continuous monitoring
2. **Cardinality Explosion**: Unbounded metrics causing memory issues
   - *Mitigation*: Cardinality limits and automated monitoring

### Medium Risks
1. **Integration Complexity**: Breaking existing functionality
   - *Mitigation*: Wrapper patterns and comprehensive testing
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Exposing sensitive data
   - *Mitigation*: Multi-layer data sanitization and access controls

### Low Risks
1. **Configuration Errors**: Wrong monitoring settings
   - *Mitigation*: Configuration validation and safe defaults
