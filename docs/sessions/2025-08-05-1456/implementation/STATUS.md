3. **InstrumentedTelemetry** (`internal/monitoring/instrumented_telemetry.go`)
   - Wraps existing telemetry operations with job monitoring
   - Provides monitored versions of:
     - BTC transaction indexing (10-minute timeout)
     - ICY transaction indexing (10-minute timeout)
     - ICY swap transaction indexing (10-minute timeout)
     - Swap request processing (15-minute timeout)

4. **Circuit Breakers** (`internal/monitoring/circuit_breaker.go`)
   - Wraps BTC RPC and Base RPC with fault tolerance
   - Configurable failure thresholds and timeouts
   - Automatic state transitions (Closed → Open → Half-Open)
   - Comprehensive error classification and metrics

5. **Jobs Health Endpoint** (`internal/handler/health/jobs.go`)
   - Comprehensive background job health reporting
   - Critical job identification and health assessment
   - Three-tier status reporting (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
   - Detailed job summaries with execution statistics

### Integration Points

1. **Server Initialization** (`internal/server/server.go`)
   - Creates monitoring components with production-ready configuration
   - Wraps external APIs with circuit breakers
   - Integrates instrumented telemetry with cron jobs
   - Configures circuit breaker timeouts and thresholds

2. **HTTP Server** (`internal/transport/http/http.go`)
   - HTTP metrics middleware for all requests
   - Comprehensive metrics registry with all monitoring components
   - Metrics endpoint at `/metrics` for Prometheus scraping

3. **Handler Integration** (`internal/handler/handler.go`)
   - Health handlers updated with job status manager
   - Metrics handler configured with central registry

### Prometheus Metrics Exposed

1. **HTTP Metrics:**
   - `icy_backend_http_requests_total` - Total HTTP requests by method, endpoint, status
   - `icy_backend_http_request_duration_seconds` - Request duration histogram

2. **External API Metrics:**
   - `icy_backend_external_api_calls_total` - Total external API calls by service, operation, status
   - `icy_backend_external_api_duration_seconds` - API call duration histogram
   - `icy_backend_external_api_timeouts_total` - API timeout counter
   - `icy_backend_circuit_breaker_state` - Circuit breaker state gauge

3. **Background Job Metrics:**
   - `icy_backend_background_job_runs_total` - Total job runs by name and status
   - `icy_backend_background_job_duration_seconds` - Job execution duration histogram
   - `icy_backend_background_jobs_active` - Currently running jobs gauge

    ConsecutiveFailureThreshold: 5,
    Timeout:                     30 * time.Second,
    Interval:                    60 * time.Second,
}
